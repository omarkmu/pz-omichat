description=[h2]Features[/h2]
description=This mod aims to be as configurable as possible. The vast majority of the features listed below can be configured or completely disabled via [url=https://github.com/omarkmu/pz-omichat/blob/main/docs/sandbox-options.md]sandbox options.[/url]

description=The default settings are tailored to usage for roleplay; by default, chats other than /all and /pm will use character forenames instead of usernames. Additionally, chat will use a colon for names instead of square brackets. Both of these can be reverted using the sandbox options.
