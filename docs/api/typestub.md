# Type Stub

Although there isn't full API documentation, the following type stub can be used as a reference.
The annotations are compatible with [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io/).

Using LLS, you can add this stub as a [library](https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/#workspacelibrary) to reference the API functions.

The typestub is available on this site for download [here](./typestub.lua).

<!-- typestub generated on deploy -->
```lua
{{#include typestub.lua}}
```
