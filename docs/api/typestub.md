# Type Stub

Although there isn't full API documentation, the following type stub can be used as a reference.

The annotations in this stub are compatible with [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io/).
You can add it as a [library](https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/#workspacelibrary) to reference the API functions.
