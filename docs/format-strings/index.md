# Format Strings

Various [sandbox options](../sandbox-options/index.md) use a format string style designed to be flexible enough to satisfy most needs.
These format strings can utilize a number of features, which are outlined in this section of the reference guide.

- [Tokens](./tokens.md): placeholders for values that will be replaced when the format string is used.
- [Functions](./functions.md): used to include logic in format strings.
- [At-Maps](./at-maps.md): multimaps which can be used for lists and logic branches.
- [Escapes & References](./escapes-references.md): escapes and references for special characters.
