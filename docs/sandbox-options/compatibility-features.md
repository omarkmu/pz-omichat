# Compatibility Features

These [options](./index.md) options control compatibility patches for other mods.
They have no effect if the relevant mod is not active.
As of now, there is only one such feature.

### EnableCompatTAD
**Default:** `true`

Enables the compatibility patch for [True Actions Act 3 - Dancing](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2648779556).

This adds a `/dance` command that makes the player perform a random dance that they know.
It also allows for selecting particular dances by name; a list of available dance names can be found by using `/help dance` or `/dance list`.
