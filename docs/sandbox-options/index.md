# Sandbox Options

In order to be as configurable as possible, this mod offers a *lot* of sandbox options.
This section serves as an explanation of these options.

Many of the sandbox options accept [format strings](../format-strings/index.md).
The dollar-sign-prefixed *[tokens](../format-strings/tokens.md)* that these format strings accept are listed in their documentation.

- [Basic Features](./basic-features.md): Feature flags and other basic options.
- [Compatibility Features](./compatibility-features.md): Options to control compatibility with other mods.
- [Chat Ranges](./ranges.md): Options for distance ranges.
- [Filters & Predicates](./filters-predicates.md): Logic override options.
- [Default Colors](./colors.md): Default colors for chat streams.
- [Roleplay Languages](./languages.md): Configuration of roleplay languages.
- [Component Formats](./component-formats.md): Format strings used by other options.
- [Overhead Formats](./overhead-formats.md): Format strings that control the overhead speech bubbles.
