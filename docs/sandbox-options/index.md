# Sandbox Options

In order to be as configurable as possible, this mod offers a *lot* of sandbox options.
This document serves as an explanation of these options.

Many of the sandbox options accept [format strings](../format-strings/index.md).
The dollar-sign-prefixed *[tokens](../format-strings/tokens.md)* that these format strings accept are listed in their documentation.

To include special characters, [character references](../format-strings/index.md#character-references) may be used.
