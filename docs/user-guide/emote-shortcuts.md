# Emote Shortcuts

The `EnableEmotes` [option](../sandbox-options/basic-features.md#enableemotes) allows players to use emote shortcuts in the form of `.emote` in local chats.
These emote shortcuts cause a player's character to play the animation associated with the emote, but they don't show up in the chat message.

For example, sending the message `Don't shoot! .surrender` would result in the following:

This can be useful for text roleplay servers, since players can play an animation in sync with their message.
The shortcuts can also be used without a message; sending `.hi` will play the animation without sending a message in chat.

## Shortcut list
