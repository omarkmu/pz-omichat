# Emotes

The `AllowEmotes` [option](./sandbox-options.md#allowemotes) enables emote shortcuts in the form of `.emote` in local chats.
These cause a player's character to play the animation associated with the emote, but they don't show up in the chat message.

The following is a list of available emotes.
Players can use the `/emotes` command to view this list in-game.
