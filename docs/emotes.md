# Emotes

The `EnableEmotes` [option](./sandbox-options.md#enableemotes) allows players to use emote shortcuts in the form of `.emote` in local chats.
These emote shortcuts cause a player's character to play the animation associated with the emote, but they don't show up in the chat message.

The following table contains the available emotes.
Players can use the `/emotes` command to view a list in-game.
